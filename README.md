# Description 

This is a simple Pokédex app created with Next.js, React, TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. It uses Axios and a Wrapper Library with TypeScript support and pre-defined types, as recommended by [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2). 

## Features 🧠

* The App fetches a random Pokémon when the users enters the app, and when the page is refreshed. 

* The user can search for any Pokémon and if the Pokémon exist, it will be displayed with the Pokémons name, type and moves. 

Thats about it. 

Let's have a sneak peak:

## Contributions 👨‍🚒

Feel free to create a PR with suggestions and extra features! You can also play around with the
different backgrounds that I have added to the project (they are made with AI).

 If you create new components, please use the "Template.tsx" as a template, and follow the existing structure so that we can keep the code consistent and clean! 
 
 However, if you want to use Zod or other liberaries for type safety,
and use the [PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2) directly instead, go ahead and replace the existing solution!
